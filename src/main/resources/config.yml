## Use Permissions
## Set to true to check against Bukkit permissions
## Setting to false will allow ALL players to use Silktouch
## If no Permissions are setup it defaults to OP only
## Permision node: silktouchhands.silktouch
## Default true
use_permissions: true

## Infinity Cake
## By default this is disabled. it is kind of OP but you can enable it
## This allows you to slicktouch a cake block. This literally allows infinate food
## The DreamSMP version of this plugin allows infinate cake but its an option here as it could be too much
## Default false
infinite_cake: false
